# NodeMCU Breakout Board

## Overview

The NodeMCU Breakout board is a development/breakout/production PCB for several of my projects, including the NodeMCU Kube Sensor and LED Controller. I created it to seat the NodeMCU in a removable way, but also to handle some of the external functions that need to be taken care of for the sensor/LED controller (DHT 22 sensor, level shifter, jumpers)
